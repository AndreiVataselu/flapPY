# flapPY

This is my first attempt at making a working game. I tried to make a clone of the huge hit game Flappy Bird without any tutorials. I tried to think what if I had the idea of the Flappy Bird? How would I make it since if it was my idea, there were no tutorials on the internet about how to create a game of this type.
